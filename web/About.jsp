         <h1>Covid-19 Patients Tracking & Hospitability </h1>
        
        <i><b><p>The project titled “Covid-19 Patients Tracking & Hospitability” is COVID Tracking Project has visualized hospital 
            capacity and COVID-19 patients at each reporting facility.The project Covid-19 Patients Tracking & Hospitability
            is developed in JAVA, which mainly focuses on Tracking the hospitals as well as covid patients available in 
            specific hospital and in some critical situation is helpful to find out the beds availability in hospital.
            As the Covid-19 pandemic unfolds across the India, one of the greatest barriers we are encountering is the absence
            of credible and consistent data. We can enter the record of patients ,patient symptoms, report, address, date to
            retrieve the details of Patients available in hospital as well as rooms and beds available for covid patients .
            We can maintain patients of Discharged or Addmitted daily records and can  also check how many hospitals are
            available in particular city and rooms available for covid patients.</p>

        <p>Throughout the project the focus has been Tracking information about the hospitals  and patients to know the best
            hospital in our particular area for covid patients. The project is very useful for those who want to know about 
            Covid-19 Patients Tracking & Hospitability.</p></b></i>
